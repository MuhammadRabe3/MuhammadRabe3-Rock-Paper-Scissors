Sure, here's an example of a basic planning or documentation for the rock-paper-scissors program we've been working on:

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line program that allows the user to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

### Inputs

The program prompts the user to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors using the keyboard.

### Outputs

The program displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the outcome of the game (win, loss, or tie) on the command line.

### Algorithm

1. Define a list of valid inputs as `values` (rock, paper, scissors).
2. Run an infinite loop that allows the user to play multiple rounds of the game.
3. Prompt the user to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
4. If the user's input is not valid, display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid input.
5. Generate a random choice for the computer using the `random.choice()` function.
6. Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the outcome of the game.
7. Display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the outcome of the game on the command line.
8. Prompt the user to play again or quit.
9. If the user chooses to quit, exit the loop and end the program.

### Example Code

```python
import random

values = ['r', 's', 'p']

while True:
    # Prompt the user to enter their choice
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (r for rock, p for paper, s for scissors): ").lower()

    # Check if the user's input is valid
    if user_choice not in values:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter 'r', 'p', or 's'.")
        continue

    # Generate a random choice for the computer
    computer_choice = random.choice(values)

    # Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the outcome of the game
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        outcome = "tie"
    elif (user_choice == 'r' and computer_choice == 's') or (user_choice == 'p' and computer_choice == 'r') or (user_choice == 's' and computer_choice == 'p'):
        outcome = "win"
    else:
        outcome = "loss"

    # Display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the outcome of the game
    print(f"You chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"The computer chose: {computer_choice}")
    print(f"You {outcome}!")

    # Prompt the user to play again or quit
    play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (y/n): ").lower()
    if play_again != 'y':
        break
```

### Possible Improvements

- Add error handling tohandle unexpected errors that may occur during the program's execution.
- Add a scoring system to keep track of the user's score and the computer's score over multiple rounds.
- Add a feature to allow the user to choose the number of rounds they want to play.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the program more user-friendly.
- Add more options for the user to choose from, such as lizard and Spock, to make the game more interesting.
- Add animations and sound effects to make the game more engaging.
